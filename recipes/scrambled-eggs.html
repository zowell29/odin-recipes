                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Prepare the Eggs:</strong> Crack the desired number of fresh eggs into a mixing bowl. For a richer texture, you can add a tablespoon of milk per egg, but this step is optional.</li>
                        <li><strong>Whisk the Eggs:</strong> Using a fork or a whisk, beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are fully combined. This step will create a smooth and uniform mixture for your scrambled eggs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Season to Taste:</strong> Add a pinch of salt and a dash of freshly ground pepper to the egg mixture, adjusting the seasoning according to your preference. Don't overdo it, as you can always add more later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Place a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and add a tablespoon of butter. Allow the butter to melt and coat the pan evenly, ensuring the eggs won't stick during cooking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong> Pour the whisked egg mixture into the pan. As the edges begin to set, use a spatula to gently stir the eggs, creating soft curds. The key is to keep the heat gentle and avoid cooking the eggs too quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Texture:</strong> Continue stirring occasionally until the eggs reach your desired level of doneness. Be careful not to overcook them, as this can result in dry and rubbery eggs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once the scrambled eggs are soft, fluffy, and cooked to perfection, remove the pan from the heat. If desired, garnish with chopped chives or parsley for an added touch of freshness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enjoy Your Scrambled Eggs:</strong> Plate the scrambled eggs and serve them hot. They pair wonderfully with buttered toast, hash browns, or a side of fresh fruit. Sit back, savor every delightful bite, and relish the simple yet satisfying flavors of these classic scrambled eggs.</li>
